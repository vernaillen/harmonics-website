title: About Wouter and Harmonics BV
---

Harmonics BV is the new name of Vernaillen Consulting BVBA.
The company was started by Wouter Vernaillen in 2013 as an IT Consultancy Company, offering web portal development services.

After health issues in 2020, Wouter experienced the healing power of sound and music and decided to follow a sound healing training [from Surya at Akasha Retreat Center](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/) in 2021/2022.<br/>
Combined with modest electronic music production skills and dj-skills from a previous life, Wouter decided to start creating and playing music for holistic healing and dance.

In May 2022 Wouter played a first Ecstatic Dance session at a private birthday event: [Rebirth Ecstatic Dance @ Krimpvarkie Huisi](/en/blog/rebirthecstaticdance).<br/>A few more Ecstatic Dance sessions are currently being planned for later this summer and autumn. Soon there will be more news about that.
