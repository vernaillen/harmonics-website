> A trance dance is a powerful experience, that invites you to return home, deep within yourself. In many contemporary forms of dance the emphasis lies on recreational and social aspects, such as watching and being watched.<br>Trance dancing is usually not intended to communicate with the outside world, but takes place within the context of spirituality, personal growth and inner transformation. A contemporary trance dance is a powerful experience that invites you to drop your masks of limited conditioning and separation and come home deep within yourself.

### Blindfolded dance meditation

By dancing blindfolded and no longer letting visual stimuli in, you can sink into your body more easily and other sensations become stronger.<br>
While dancing we come out of our head, into our body and make an inner journey.<br>

You can start the dance with a specific intention, an insight you are willing to receive, something to process, or simply to celebrate life.

### Concept

In the winter and spring of 2023 we plan monthly Trance Dance sessions at [vzw Dwarsligger in Melle](https://www.dwarsligger33.com/){target='blank'}, each time in co-creation with a different facilitator.
Combining Trance Dance with breathwork, a drum circle or sound healing provides an even more profound experience.

The music for the trance dance is carefully selected by [Wouter](/about), usually around one specific theme. A lot of attention is put into creating a profound, compelling flow.
A recent [sound healing training](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/soundhealing-training){target='_blank'}, and modest DJ skills from a past life, come in handy.
