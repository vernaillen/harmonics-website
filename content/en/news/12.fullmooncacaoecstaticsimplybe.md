# Full Moon ~ Cacao ~ Ecstatic Dance

Come and enjoy our Volle Maan ~ Cacao ~ Ecstatic Dance with us on 25 February from 3pm!

Together, under the guidance of Sandrine, we ceremoniously connect with the Cacao medicine and place our intentions.
DJ Harmonics then takes us on a compelling, ecstatic dance journey with shamanic, tribal and southern sounds from all over the world!

DJ Harmonics (Wouter Vernaillen) combines trance dance and sound healing knowledge with DJ skills from a past life. In addition to facilitating trance dance, he enjoys providing live DJ sets for Ecstatic Dance.

Cocoa is a gentle medicine that, among other things, opens the heart. It provides a warm and energetic feeling where there is room to consciously be present in the here and now. In addition, it has numerous positive effects on the body's self-healing capacity.
