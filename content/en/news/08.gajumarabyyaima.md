# Why Gajumara means so much to me

I hadn't heared about Yaima yet until I saw them live in January 2020 on a conscious dance festival in Akasha Ubud.
Not long after, when I returned to Belgium, the pandemic started and I caught a Covid infection which cause me to have pericarditis.

Slowly I recovered and during my healing I discovered spirituality. With each new phase in my recovery a different part of the lyrics of Gajumaru would resonate with me. 
The song stayed with me during my recovery and kinda guided me through the process.

## Lyrics

[Intro]
> (ohhh, ohhh woho, ohhh, ohhh woho)

[Verse 1]
> Creating concrete visions of a macrocosmic prism with a brilliant optimism and appropriate ambition
To be open from the center redirected to the moment
This is it love, this is it love, unrestrainable nature
We can change it from the edges, we can challenge all our borders
There is always a new leader, there is always a new order
Our pathway is proceeding and the way is always changing
We are free from what prevents us to realise our destination
(ohhh, ohhh woho, ohhh, ohhh woho)

[Refrain]
> Free, from all old stories I've been told, I walk through the valley of my own shadow
Free, from all old stories I've been told, I walk through the valley of my own shadow

[Verse 2]
> Awareness is my virtue and I'm grateful for the search to
Dive deep within my own mind and to trust the intuition of the lives I've lived before this are essential form of knowsis it's a simple form of freedom it's as smooth as inhalation, oh the exhale is releasing all the tension I've been feeling, on the surface and beneath me I'm connecting to my spirit, and I'm here now right before you, I am present in this moment, my life's work is to honour the great beauty all around you
(ohhh, ohhh woho, ohhh, ohhh woho)

[Refrain]
> Free from all old stories I've been told, I walk through the valley of my own shadow
Free from all old stories I've been told, I walk through the valley of my own shadow

> [Verse 3]
Creating concrete visions of a macrocosmic prism with a brilliant optimism and appropriate ambition
To be open from the center redirected to the moment
This is it love, this is it love, unrestrainable nature

> [Outro]
This is it love
This is it love
This is it love
This is it love
