## Tracklist

- **Intro**: Jonathan Goldman - Ultimate Om
During the first 2 and a half minute you can hear this Om sound. This intro allows the facilitator to incite the participants to connect with their breath and start the breath of fire before the music starts.
- From 2:30 to about 1:15:00 participants can move and dance freely. Both faciliators join the dance (without blindfold) to ensure the safety of the dancers and avoid collisions.
Tracks:
    - Aleceo - Senegal (Original Mix)
    - Rey&Kjavik - Ulima
    - Mercan Dede - Mercanistan
    - Anilah - Medicine Chant
    - Mercan Dede - Alef
    - Tikki Masala - Tribal Groove
    - Poranguí - Oxum
    - David Parsons - Urartu to Ubud
    - Geju - Niv
    - Deya Dova - Song For Charli
    - Shaman's Dream - Water Spirits
    - Maneesh De Moor - Drops of light
- **Integration**: Frank Natale (Professor Trance)- Mother OM
Around 1:15:00 the dancers can lie down and a blanket is placed over them. An Om sound will sound again for about 10 minutes.
- **Returning into the space**: Alexia Chellun - The Power Is Here Now
Around 1:26:00 the participants are invited by the facilitator to slowly come back into the room, and as soon as they are ready, the blindfold can be removed.
