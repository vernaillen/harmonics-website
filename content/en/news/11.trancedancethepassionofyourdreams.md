# Trance Dance 4 december 2023

We like to invite you for a Trance Dance session at De Ringelwikke in Ronse on Monday December 4.

Facilitators for this session are [Karien 'Iztacitlal' Detavernier](https://www.shamanour.be/autobiografie) and [Wouter Vernaillen](/about).

## The Passion Of Your Dreams

The theme for this trance dance session is "The Passion Of Your Dreams". Passion Gives Your Dreams Wings.

Something that can help us get our passion and enthusiasm back is to let our inner child out, that child in us with big dreams.
We all have one. 
Do you remember what it was like to be a child? What things did you enjoy or think were exciting? 

During this blindfolded trance dance session we invite you to let your inner child dance, so you can  (re)connect with the passion of your dreams.

>"We have to listen to the child we once were, the child who still exists inside us. That child understands magic moments.‚Äù

~ Paulo Coelho ~
