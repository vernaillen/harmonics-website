## Join us on Sunday afternoon October 15 for our New Maan ~ Cacao ~ Ecstatic Dance!

We ceremoniously connect with the Cacao medicine and place our intentions, guided by Sandrine.
DJ Harmonics then takes us on a compelling, ecstatic dance journey with shamanic, tribal and southern sounds from all over the world!

DJ Harmonics (Wouter Vernaillen) combines trance dance and sound healing knowledge with DJ skills from a past life. In addition to facilitating trance dance, he enjoys providing live DJ sets for Ecstatic Dance.

Cocoa is a gentle medicine that, among other things, opens the heart. It provides a warm and energetic feeling where there is room to consciously be present in the here and now. In addition, it has numerous positive effects on the body's self-healing capacity.
