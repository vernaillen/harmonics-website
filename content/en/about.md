title: About Wouter and Harmonics
---

In 2020 Wouter personally experienced the healing power of sound and music and decided in 2021 to follow a sound healing training [provided by Surya at Akasha Retreat Center](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/).
Combined with modest electronic music production skills and dj-skills from a previous life, Wouter decided to start creating and playing music for holistic healing and dance.

From August to the end of October 2022, Wouter followed the [Trance Dance Facilitator Training](https://trance-dance.net/events/trancedance-facilitator-training/) by Aernoudt Knecht.
