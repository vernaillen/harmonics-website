## About Wouter

In 2020 I personally experienced the healing power of sound and music and in 2021 I decided to follow a sound healing training [provided by Surya at Akasha Retreat Center](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/).
Combined with modest electronic music production skills and dj-skills from a previous life, I started creating and playing music for holistic healing and dance.

The search and selection of music for ecstatic dance and trance dance sessions and creating immersive dance flows is what I really love doing.
I also like to co-create with another spaceholder. Thereful I'm very gratefull for the beautiful collaborations with Rita (my fellow student from the trance dance facilitator training), [Frouke Vermeulen](https://www.artsoundmedicinewoman.com/about/) and [Karien Detavernier](https://www.shamanour.be/autobiografie).

## Ecstatic dance
In May 2022 I played a first Ecstatic Dance session at a private birthday event: [Rebirth Ecstatic Dance @ Krimpvarkie Huisi](/en/news/rebirthecstaticdance). 2 more ED sessions followed in the summer of 2022, including [Release Your Inner Dancer](/en/news/releaseyourinnerdancer) on September 3.
If you're not familiar yet with Ecstatic Dance you can read about it in this [blogpost: What is Ecstatic Dance?](/en/news/watisecstaticdance)

## Trance dance
From August to the end of October 2022, I followed the [Trance Dance Facilitator Training](https://trance-dance.net/events/trancedance-facilitator-training/) by Aernoudt Knecht and got [certified](https://trance-dance.net/international/facilitators/wouter-vernaillen/).
After a successful first Trance dance session on October 17, [monthly Trance Dance sessions](/en/trancedance) will take place starting from January 2023.
