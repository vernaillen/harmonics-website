# Sound Healing Training and Tapasya

When I'm writing this I'm in the aftermath of the very first weekend of the sound healing training organised by Surya at Akasah Retreat Center.

## What is Tapasya?

- Achievable and clearly defined goal
- try to control lust and desires and don't let them get in the way of that goal

## My commitment

- For 23 days, every morning from 7am to 8am (and in weekends at 8am), I will do a 40 minute chakra meditation, followed by 15 minutes of Aquaria.
- Chakra meditation, as we learned from Surya. Vocal toning of the chakra's with our own voice.
- Aquera is a more scientific approach, where a set of sounds is defined based on a brain and voice scan. Listening for 15 minutes daily to this audio: \
  \
  `Using advanced computer technology, the Aquera software is able to connect vocal vibrations and brain waves to emotions. The system identifies and determines the underlying emotions by relating the vocal or brainwave input to the algorithms of specific processes in different parts of the brain.`\
  `Once the analysis is completed, it is possible to restore emotional balance, using personalized sound frequencies. These unique frequencies can be combined with our light device, one of our recent enhancements to the system. `\
