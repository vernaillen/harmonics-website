Ecstatic dance is a form of dance in which the dancers abandon themselves to the rhythm and move freely,
as the music helps them to let go of any tension and blocked energy and leads them into trance and ecstatic feelings.

Dancers are described as feeling deeply connected to others and to their own emotions. The dance serves as a form of meditation, helping people to cope with stress and to attain serenity.

Ecstatic Dance session often start with a form of meditation, allowing the dancers to connect consciously with their inner self. Then slow music invites them to start moving, and steadily the music will build up and take the dancers on a journey of released emotions and ecstatic feelings.

As a dancer you are welcome as you are, you are invited to move as you feel and let your body guide you.

There are a few rules to allow each dancer to fully expreience the dance in safe and conscious way:

* no chitchat during the dance
* no booze or drugs
* dance barefoot, no shoes
* repect the space of yoiur fellow dancers
