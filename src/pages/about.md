# {{frontmatter.title}}

Harmonics BV is the new name of Vernaillen Consulting BVBA.
The company was started by Wouter Vernaillen in 2013 as an IT Consultancy Company, offering web portal development services.

After having health issues in 2020, Wouter learned about the power of sound and music for healing and  followed a sound healing training at [Akasha Retreat Center](https://www.akasharetreatcenter.com/) in 2021/2022.
Combined with modest electronic music production skills gained over the past few years and dj-skills from a previous life, Wouter decided to focus on production and performance of music for holistic healing and dance (while also still offering the IT consultancy services).

In May 2022 Wouter played a first Ecstatic Dance session at a private birthday event: [Rebirth Ecstatic Dance @ Krimpvarkie Huisi](https://www.mixcloud.com/woutervernaillen/rebirth-ecstatic-dance-krimpvarkie-huisi/).
A few more Ecstatic Dance sessions will be planned later this summer.
